Burglary, as it happens, requires architecture: it is a spatial crime. Without buildings, burglary, in its current legal form, could not exist. Committing it requires an inside and an outside; it\u2019s impossible without boundaries, thresholds, windows, and walls. In fact, one needn\u2019t steal anything at all to be a burglar. In a sense, as a crime, it is part of the built environment; the design of any structure always implies a way to break into it. Connection to computer security left as exercise to the reader.\nTrial by Machine (Roth) -- The current landscape of mechanized proof, liability, and punishment suffers from predictable but underscrutinized automation pathologies: hidden subjectivities and errors in \u201cblack box\u201d processes; distorted decision-making through oversimplified \u2014 and often dramatically inaccurate \u2014 proxies for blameworthiness; the compromise of values protected by human safety valves, such as dignity, equity, and mercy; and even too little mechanization where machines might be a powerful debiasing tool but where little political incentive exists for its development or deployment. [...] The article ultimately proposes a systems approach \u2013 \u201ctrial by cyborg\u201d \u2013 that safeguards against automation pathologies while interrogating conspicuous absences in mechanization through \u201cequitable surveillance\u201d and other means.

Behaviourism, as the name implies, looks at behaviour without looking at what the brain and neurons are doing, while cognitivism looks at the mental processes that underlie behaviour. Deep learning systems like the one built by Hill and his colleagues reflect a cognitivist approach, but for a system to have something approaching human intelligence, it would have to have a little of both. \u201cOur system can\u2019t go too far beyond the dictionary data on which it was trained, but the ways in which it can are interesting, and make it a surprisingly robust question and answer system \u2013 and quite good at solving crossword puzzles,\u201d said Hill.

The experimental results with six rats and their intelligence-augmented rat cyborgs show that rat cyborgs have the best performance in escaping from mazes. These results provide a proof-of-principle demonstration for cyborg intelligence.

Second, the application of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science for continuous algorithmic improvement constitutes an immensely expensive, sophisticated, and exclusive 21st century \u201cmeans of production.\u201d Third, the new manufacturing process converts behavioral surplus into prediction products designed to predict behavior now and soon.
