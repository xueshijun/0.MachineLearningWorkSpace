At my hotel, they listed all the flights, so it would be easy to see. I was traveling on the first flight out on a Saturday morning, and there may be other times that are much more crowded. \\u00a0\\ufeff\", \n",

With this would come a fundamental change: from procuring or buying a set solution to building California\\u2019s ability to understand, direct, and control the critical technology needed for government to do its job well....<br /><br />&quot;But why would a Child Welfare System in particular be a good choice for this new approach? Child welfare services personnel in California investigate nearly half a million reports of severe maltreatment and life-threatening neglect to children a year. Of those half a million, around 80,000 reports are confirmed annually, 30,000 children must be removed from their homes, and at any time almost 100,000 children are living in foster care for their protection or live with their parents under close county protective supervision. The Child Welfare System was the perfect choice for a new approach because it\\u2019s too important to fail.&quot;\\ufeff\", \n",

        "    \"content\": \"&quot;Surely Democrats and Republicans could agree to cut billions from a failed program like this!&quot; you think. What their failure to do so says something about politics, but I think it also speaks to the failed regulatory model that we use to manage programs like this. \\u00a0From the article: \\u00a0<br /><br />&quot;Consider the Education Management Corporation, which runs 110 schools in the United States for chefs, artists and other trades. It has been investigated or sued in recent years by prosecutors in at least 12 states. The Justice Department has accused the company of illegally using incentives to pay its recruiters. And last year, investors filed a class-action lawsuit, contending that the company engaged in deceptive enrollment practices and manipulated federal student loan and grant programs.\\u00a0Education Management nonetheless received more than $1.25 billion in federal money over the last school year....<br /><br />&quot;The continuing flow of money illustrates the quandary facing federal education officials. On one hand, they have moved forcefully to try to protect taxpayer funds and prevent students from falling deeply into debt without anything to show for it. On the other, they must avoid running roughshod over private for-profit schools that have not been found guilty of wrongdoing. Agency officials point out that they cannot withhold money based on accusations, but must have proof of misconduct.&quot;<br /><br />The fundamental notion that you can only regulate by punishing wrongdoing is at the heart of the failure. Good regulatory systems are <b>management</b> systems, that keep a system operating smoothly.<br /><br />A plane&#39;s autopilot does not kick in after the plane has crashed. It is designed to keep it from crashing. Credit card fraud detection software doesn&#39;t wait till you&#39;ve gone bankrupt from fraudulent charges to intervene and stop further transactions. Google search quality doesn&#39;t reserve space in the top spots for spammers lest it hurt their business!<br /><br />These practical and commercial regulatory regimes should be a model for how we think about government regulation as well.<br /><br />I&#39;ve written about this topic at greater length in my article Open Data and Algorithmic Regulation: \\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/\\\">http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/</a>\\ufeff\", \n",

        "    \"content\": \"I was a Reagan fan, back in 1980.<br /><br />You have to cut me some slack. I was 17. Today, 35 years later -- I&#39;m still a bit of a Reagan fan. Not much for the things he actually did, though there are some things I can point at even today and say he got right -- but for what he claimed to want.<br /><br />(What did he do? California&#39;s Briggs Iniative, in 1978. It would have prevented gay Americans from working in schools. The Anita Bryant wing of the Republican Party was all in favor of it. Reagan, who was about to run for President, got pushed hard to at least keep his mouth shut bout it -- instead he wrote a letter opposing it, and an editorial in the Herald-Examiner against it as well.<br /><br />(What else? I&#39;m unclear that anything the U.S. did actually accelerated the collapse of the Soviet Union; the idea that we spent them into bankruptcy is not really falsifiable. But he was right to stand against it -- he did and never wavered.)<br /><br />But where Reagan touched me, moved me, really connected with me to the point where I was prepared to become a conservative murderbot and Spread the Good News, was when he talked about the evils of deficit spending, the evils of borrowing from your children.<br /><br />&quot;You and I, as individuals,&quot; he said, &quot;can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but only for a limited period of time. Why should we think that collectively as a nation we are not bound by that same limitation?&quot;<br /><br />It made sense to me then, and it makes sense to me now. No, a country is not a household; I&#39;ve seen that meme too. But a country is a finite set of resources, and when those resources are heading out of the country to pay overseas lenders, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars a year, son, you got a condition.<br /><br />I&#39;m not going to spend a lot of time discussing the extraordinary gap in performance on the deficit between Democratic and Republican administrations, post-1980. In Republican Administrations the deficit goes up, and in Democratic Administrations the deficit goes down. Period. This is a 35-year coincidental correlation, at this point -- and it&#39;s not the House, which allegedly holds the power of the purse; the deficit&#39;s gone up with Democratic Houses and Republican Presidents, down with Democratic Houses and Republican Presidents; up with Republican Houses and Republican Presidents (exploded under Bush and Speaker Hastert) -- and down with Republican Houses and Democratic Presidents. (Indeed -- Republican House and Republican President is the worst combination; Republican House and Democratic President the best, by far, for controlling spending. There&#39;s something to be said for the hatred Republicans have for Democratic Presidents.)<br /><br />But I am going to spend some time breaking down Ronald Reagan&#39;s performance on the deficit, because he&#39;s pretty much where all this started: said one thing, did very much another.<br /><br />Let&#39;s start by dismissing the argument that the House was responsible for all this. It&#39;s not true, at its core. Ronald Reagan requested $29.4 billion more in spending than Congress passed. Conservative/libertarian types will dispute this. If you want to understand how this gag works, read here:<br /><br /><a href=\\\"http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/56More.htm\\\">http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/56More.htm</a><br /><br />So Congress was slightly more responsible than Reagan, yeah. This isn&#39;t saying much: those budgets were disasters, and the disaster was almost immediately evident to everyone: in fiscal 1981 the deficit was $78B, the debt was $994B, and the debt as a percentage of GDP was 34% -- that last number is the best way to understand what&#39;s going on with these numbers; inflation lowers the value of the dollar, over time, but GDP is GDP.<br /><br />By 1989 the deficit was $152B, the debt was 2.9 Trillion, and the debt as a percentage of GDP was 55%.<br /><br />What caused this? Tax cuts, and spending hikes. You think Democrats spend like crazy, you haven&#39;t paid attention to either of the Reagan or Bush II administrations.<br /><br />A word in favor of very nearly the last Republican politician I actually liked -- Bush I loved his country, raised taxes, and primed the pump for the Clinton Administration&#39;s eventual elimination of the deficit, and a decade of economic good times. Clinton mostly gets credit for that, but it was him, a brave Democratic Congress in the year of Clinton&#39;s first budget, and George HW Bush, who deserve the credit. (Don&#39;t the Republicans in the House, who fought Clinton at every turn deserve some credit? Well, at the level of causing complete paralysis, they do; the modern House deserves the same sort of credit for Obama&#39;s budget deficits dropping. I&#39;m not clear if seething hatred is really praiseworthy, but at the level of only caring about results, thanks, guys.)<br /><br />But back to Reagan -- we can argue Obama another decade. (And will, for all the decades I have left.)<br /><br />One of the things Reagan gets credit for is that, in the face of mounting deficits, he <b>did</b> in fact raise taxes. Several times. And he did. But it&#39;s worthwhile, comparing his tax cuts and his tax hikes.<br /><br /><a href=\\\"http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/reagan-tax-increases/\\\">http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/reagan-tax-increases/</a><br /><br />The total of Reagan&#39;s tax cuts: $275B.<br /><br />The total of Reagan&#39;s tax hikes: $133B.<br /><br />So one of those numbers is twice as big as the other. And what&#39;s more, they&#39;re different <b>kinds</b> of tax cuts and tax hikes. They redistributed the tax burden: the cuts helped the wealthy; the hikes hit the middle and working classes. Ronald Reagan, in eight years, shifted the tax burden from the wealthy to the middle class and poor, and took a debt that had required 80-odd years to create (a debt that Robert Heinlein found horrifying when it was still relatively <b>small</b>) -- and tripled it in two terms.<br /><br />I missed voting for Ronald Reagan by three weeks: I turned 18 on November 30, 1980. It&#39;s a truism that people tend to stick with their first votes; they&#39;ve got skin in the game, they want the person they voted for to succeed, and whichever party that person belongs to, is the party they tend to vote for, going forward, for the rest of their lives. (And this is why Obama&#39;s two great performances with the young is so long-term scary for the GOP -- it&#39;s not just that they voted Democratic now; they&#39;re going to vote Democrat til they die.)<br /><br />Alternate worlds -- I can picture a world where I&#39;d been born on November 1, instead of November 30. I&#39;d have voted for Reagan, without a doubt. (I thought then, and think now, that Jimmy Carter was a terrible President.) Would I then have spent the next four years desperately searching for justifications for his brutal budgets, his failure to deliver on the thing that made me a Reaganista in the first place? I don&#39;t know. I like to think not, but people are far more rationalizing than rational, to mention Robert Heinlein for the second time.<br /><br />Somewhere in another splinter of time, is a slightly older version of me busy writing the exact opposite of this piece, with the same conviction with which I wrote this one? Maybe. If so, hi there, Dan: I love you anyway. You&#39;re wrong, though.\\ufeff\", \n",

We heard this morning that our friend Jake Brewer was killed yesterday in a bike accident.\\u00a0<br /><br />I try to take comfort in poetry. I have always loved Wallace Stevens&#39; thoughts in Esthetique du Mal in moments like this:<br /><br />&quot;He breathes a summer sleep,<br />In which his wound is good because life was.<br />No part of him was ever part of death.&quot;<br /><br />And yes, there is somehow a deep continuity, in which we all one way or another come to that moment of our undoing, and our end is just one more part of a good life. None of us know when it will be. So we have to make the most of each moment - and that&#39;s what Jake did, throwing himself into life, fully.<br /><br />But it&#39;s still a tragedy. Edna St Vincent Millay captured that tragedy perfectly in Dirge without Music:<br /><br />&quot;I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.<br />So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:<br />Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned<br />With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.<br /><br />Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.<br />Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.<br />A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,<br />A formula, a phrase remains,\\u2014but the best is lost.<br /><br />The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,\\u2014<br />They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled<br />Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.<br />More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.<br /><br />Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave<br />Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;<br />Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.<br />I know.

Perhaps this is a boilerplate observation, so obvious in light of what happened there, and all our other disasters and chronic problems\\u200a\\u2014\\u200athe Iraq war, political gridlock, gun violence, and a thousand other things. But I believe this is an under-appreciated point. America is an optimistic nation. It has a short memory. Our political system and media don\\u2019t really learn very obvious lessons that unspool right in front of everyone\\u2019s faces. And so we end up repeating our errors\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aat least, some of them\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ato great sorrow. And I expect the sorrow is going to get a lot greater in the coming decades.&quot;<br /><br />My recollection is that someone shared a photoset on Flickr, and that was the eye opener for me about how bad things were post-Katrina.

What&#39;s the Future of Work? \\u00a0It&#39;s a look at robots, AI, and the on-demand economy, and what they tell us about the future of work, the shape of corporations, and the issues we should be grappling with now if we want these profound changes to come out for the best.<br /><br />My co-host for the event is Steven Levy of Medium. While the speaker list is still preliminary, it tells the story of what we&#39;re going after. Explore the speaker pages - I&#39;ve loaded them with quotes from the speakers, which will help you understand in advance where they are coming from. Over the next few weeks and months, we&#39;ll be curating an online conversation, with lots of great reading and viewing, to engage with these ideas, whether or not you are coming to the event.\\ufeff\", \n",

        "   \"annotation\": \"Silicon Valley entrepreneurs talk all the time about &quot;disruption,&quot; and are looking for new markets to tackle. \\u00a0Well, government (Federal, State, and Local) is almost a third of the US economy. \\u00a0And as all of us know, there&#39;s a lot that could be improved. \\u00a0But many people either don&#39;t know, or don&#39;t care to know, just how big an impact their skills can have when applied to some of the hardest, most interesting problems our society has to offer.<br /><br />The Code for America Fellowship is an annual program, which sends small startup teams to work with cities for a year on interesting and important problems identified by their host cities. After the Fellowship year, Fellows sometimes go on to continue their work inside government, sometimes they create startups to continue their work, or find other ways to keep after the problem they&#39;ve got their teeth into. \\u00a0And sometimes, they go back to work in the commercial world re-energized and more deeply aware of the impact that tech can have on the wider world, and better citizens thereby.<br /><br />Fellows include programmers, designers, researchers, and project managers - a wide range of skills. Learn more at\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/\\\">http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/</a>\\u00a0<br /><br />Fellows come from a variety of backgrounds in technology. Some come from large, well-known tech companies or startup environments, while others have experience working in government or social impact organizations. All of our fellows have a creative, entrepreneurial spirit and are passionate about the work that they do. All fellows receive a $50K stipend to support their time as a fellow, as well as full benefits and educational loan deferment.\\u00a0<br /><br />Here are some of the projects the Fellows have worked on during the past five years:<br /><br />* &quot;Debugging&quot; SNAP (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, commonly referred to as Food Stamps) to understand why the application process is so complicated, why so many people fail to complete it, or otherwise fall off the rolls after they apply.<br /><br />* Building a &quot;Jail Dashboard&quot; to help judges be more aware of overcrowding, and alternatives to incarceration, when sentencing. \\u00a0We are going deep on how we can improve the criminal justice system.<br /><br />* Monitoring and measuring blight in cities to help government and citizens figure out what to do to improve their neighborhood.<br /><br />* Creating new tools for citizen engagement in urban planning.<br /><br />* Making it easier for cities to respond to public records requests.<br /><br />The video below gives a quick look at some of the people who&#39;ve gone through the program before you.<br /><br />Apply here: <a href=\\\"http://codeforamerica.org/apply\\\">codeforamerica.org/apply</a>\", \n",

The idea of your nice little green grass getting lots of water every day - that&#39;s going to be a thing of the past.</b><br /><br />But what about agriculture?\\u00a0\\u00a0 In California, about 50% of water is used by &quot;the environment&quot;: rivers, wetlands, parks and the like.\\u00a0 40% is used by agriculture.\\u00a0 10% is left for businesses and residents.\\u00a0<br /><br />Brown didn&#39;t impose any cuts on agriculture!\\u00a0 That sounds unfair, and people are complaining.\\u00a0\\u00a0 More water is used to <i>grow walnuts</i> than to keep Los Angeles going!<br /><br />We definitely need to improve agriculture.\\u00a0 But don&#39;t forget: for the second year in a row, farmers in California&#39;s big Central Valley are getting hit with big water cutbacks.\\u00a0 The ones who get water from the State Water Project will receive only 20% of their usual amount.\\u00a0\\u00a0<br /><br />Is all this due to climate change?\\u00a0 I heard a wise answer to that question:\\u00a0 instead of a definite yes or no, just: <i>this is what climate change looks like</i>.\\u00a0 This is the kind of thing we can expect.<br /><br />And on the <b>Road to Paris</b>, this week the US submitted a plan to cut carbon emissions by 25% by 2030... but that&#39;s another story.\\u00a0 Or another part of the same big story.<br /><br />What California is doing about the drought:<br /><br /><a href=\\\"http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ag-water-20150403-story.html\\\">http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ag-water-20150403-story.html</a><br /><br />Water used by agriculture in California:<br /><br /><a href=\\\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/01/almonds-nuts-crazy-stats-charts\\\">http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/01/almonds-nuts-crazy-stats-charts</a><br /><br />Make your own graphs of the California snowpack:<br /><br /><a href=\\\"http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cdecapp/snowapp/swcchart.action\\\">http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cdecapp/snowapp/swcchart.action</a><br /><br />There&#39;s lots more water data here, too - click items on the menu above.<br /><br />More on the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge or <b>Triple R</b> by Daniel Swain, the guy who coined the term:<br /><br /><a href=\\\"http://www.weatherwest.com/archives/tag/ridiculously-resilient-ridge\\\">http://www.weatherwest.com/archives/tag/ridiculously-resilient-ridge</a><br /><br />In February he wrote:<br /><br /><b>In this sense, the Triple R of 2014-2015 is notably different from 2013-2014. California has certainly received more precipitation this year on a liquid equivalent basis, though we\\u2019re once again falling rapidly behind average as February turns out to be mostly dry. The extreme warmth and low snowpack, however, are very reminiscent of recent winters\\u2013as is the occurrence of infrequent but intense warm storms. It\\u2019s interesting to note that nearly the entire western United States has been exceptionally warm in recent months, while the eastern part of the country remains locked in a recurring nightmare of extreme Arctic outbreaks and almost inconceivable snow accumulations\\u00a0in parts of New England. This overall setup\\u2013with a big Western ridge and a deep Eastern trough\\u2013has become known as the \\u201cWarm West/Cool East\\u201d dipole pattern, and it has been a common feature of recent winters in North America. There are a number of hypotheses currently being investigated regarding the causes of an apparent recent increase in the occurrence of this pattern, though there\\u2019s not yet compelling evidence pointing to a singular cause (that\\u2019s a topic for a future blog post!).</b><br /><br /><b>What is more certain, at least as far as California is concerned, is that our severe long-term drought is unlikely to improve substantially until this newly-invigorated pattern of persistent West Coast high pressure is no longer dominant.</b>\\ufeff\", \n",
